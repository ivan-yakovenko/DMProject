# Discrete Mathematics Project

## Overview

---

This project focuses on building a graph reachability matrix utilizing Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. The reachability matrix showcases the connectivity between vertices within a graph.

## Project structure 

The project repository consists of a folder named [**Project**](Project/), containing two subfolders:

- [**Algorithms**](Project/Algorithms/)
- [**UnweightedGraph**](Project/UnweightedGraph)

and a [**Program.cs**](Project/Program.cs/) file, where we conduct our experiment to analyze the performance of DFS and BFS algorithms for different graph sizes and probabilities.
